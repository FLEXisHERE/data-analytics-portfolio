# Concrete Mixer Production & Energy Waste Analysis

## Problem
On construction sites, the concrete mixer should stop at the end of the working day.
However, operators sometimes forget to turn it off, causing unnecessary energy consumption.

## Objective
- Analyze daily production cycles
- Detect abnormal operating durations
- Measure productivity (volume per hour)
- Identify potential energy waste

## Data
Operational logs containing:
- Delivery date
- Total operating duration
- Produced volume
- Production per hour

## Tools
- Power BI
- Excel / CSV

## Key Result
Average production rate: **31.45 units/hour**

## Insights
- Long operating hours with low production indicate possible energy waste
- Production efficiency varies significantly between days

## Recommendation
- Implement alerts when the mixer runs with zero production
- Monitor duration vs output daily
