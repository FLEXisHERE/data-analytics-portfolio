# Concrete Mixer Energy Optimization

## Overview
This project analyzes operational data from a construction-site concrete mixer (malaxeur).
Sometimes the mixer is left running at the end of the day, which can lead to unnecessary energy consumption.

Goal:
- Monitor production efficiency
- Detect abnormal operating durations
- Highlight potential energy waste using data visualization

## Dataset
Operational logs including:
- Production date
- Operating duration
- Produced concrete volume
- Production per hour

Source: Internal site logs (anonymized for portfolio use).

## Tools Used
- Power BI
- Excel / CSV

## What I Did
- Cleaned and structured production logs
- Calculated productivity metrics (production per hour)
- Analyzed duration vs output per day
- Built a Power BI dashboard to monitor efficiency and possible waste

## Key Insights / Results
- Average production rate ≈ 31.45 units/hour
- Some days show long operating duration with low production
- These cases indicate possible energy waste (mixer left ON)

## How to Run
1. Download the `.pbix` file from the `dashboard/` folder
2. Open it in Power BI Desktop
3. Explore filters and daily production trends
